            <p>Originally from Anchorage Alaska, I attended school at Eastern Washington University and graduated
              in 2012 with a BS in Computer Science. Alongside school I enjoyed running, rock climbing and studying foreign languages.
              My passion for the outdoors and mountains led me to move to Salt Lake City UT in 2014.</p>

              After graduation I returned to Alaska to work for Glacier Services Inc, the largest Alaskan-owned oil field automation

real-time supervisory control and data acquisition systems that Conono Phillips Alaska uses to control and meter oil and gas fields.
